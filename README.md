# Project-1---Flight-Tracking-Weather-Enthusiasts


AS A flight-tracking weather enthusiast
When A user clicks refresh
Then they will see flight data
I WANT to see which flights in the United States are currently in the air, along with the weather forecast for their corresponding airports

SO THAT I can view both the flights currently in the air as well as its corresponding airports' current weather
