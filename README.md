## Brewery-Locator

As a group of Craft Beer enjoyers, we wanted to build an application where we could type in the name of our city, or any city we may travel to (and thus, as a visitor, not be as aware of their Craft Brewery options), and be shown a list of breweries with their address, phone number, brewery type, and where they are located on a map.

This solves the problem of having to individually look at each different brewery in a new tab while searching the internet. Now, you get 5 breweries auto-populated, on one page, easy to click on with all the information you would need to make your decision. This is especially helpful when visiting a city you aren't as familiar with.

As a team, we learned how to use multiple API's that interact with one another in order to pull data from a 3rd party source for the end user to interact with. We also learned how to properly use Git and GitHub to practice proper source control, workflow, communication within a team, and work delegation.


## Features

* Ability to search for breweries by typing a City name in the search bar, which provides the names, addresses, phone numbers, and brewery types for each on a single page. 

* Ability to view where these breweries are on a map to the right side of the page.

* Ability to see your previously searched cities.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute, you can locally clone our REPO at https://github.com/ajconnally93/Project-1---Local-Brewery-Finder , create your own branch, commit any changes and create a Pull request for one of us to approve. We practice a Kanban system with individual opened Issues, tasks, and ToDos that you may set to as being 'in progress' if you choose to contribute.

## Tests

* Nashville: all map and brewery info available
* Birmingham: API missing data (address, phone number, brewery type) with 2 breweries - 'missing data' text content set to show user
* Atlanta: Brewery API missing data to pass through map API - 'missing data' text content set to show user
